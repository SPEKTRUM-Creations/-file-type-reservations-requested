Besides building these file type  definitions each of these files Will also require either programs to run these file types as default or through plug-ins or coded  modules added to existing programs that normally handle each kind of file type, respectively.  so for instance, if either Spotify or Apple Music more to incorporate the .lpz format it would either require it being hardcoded into the apps extending the functionality of either app to adopt and impliment the format on their platform

Bundle security is essential in protecting the intellectual property contained within most especially the .LPZ format as well as the .LPX format



(*) The ability to use character sets of UTF 16 or UTF 32 will be an advantage by extending the character range useful in defining functions as charachters from an extended set, such as a symbol or emoji, for easy program extensions and frameworks based off of this symbolic set of functions defined in frameworks allowing for minimal coding and easy  programmability.

(˟) This particular JS file could potentially contain embedded elements and attachments such as files in flat text or rich text, images, audio, video, etc.  The goal with The ability for this file type to have embedded elements could make it easier to make things self-contained within the script itself. Library frameworks for instance could be built with a slew of icon images for use in a project.  this could potentially blur the line between coding and displayed data or UI elements.  more most importantly the implementation of JavaScript within this document type would be similar to Apple script in that it processes natural language as script. The script's natural text commands would be accompanied by a defined subset or group of markdown charachters and punctuation, To establish structure and syntax. For instance, 


(‡) These image files will not be unlike the macromedia/adobe Fireworks PNG files, (.fw.png). This file type (.spkimg) will contain layer information that will combine roster and vector images and graphics,As well as a set of effects that can be reproduced through commonly used features that include functions like blur, shadow, glow, etc. and also layer compositing effects such as multiply, screen, erase, negative, etc.  The file type will also support an alpha layer to support transparent backgrounds.
